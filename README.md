So, I started caring about my health recently because I'm gettin' close to forty and don't feel like having a heart attack in the next 5 years like all of the other guys in my family.

Well, they did blood tests and whatnot, and.... they _weren't great_. So I had to get more tests. Then I had to see a specialist. Then some more tests.

(Don't worry, turns out I'm fine!)

Throughout this I had to use the FollowMyHealth app. It's not terrible, but it just takes forever to load, and it does allll sorts of stuff that I don't really care about 90% of the time (messaging, weird provider connection stuff, documents that I don't really care about).

So, I made this by reverse engineering the app.

 You can log in using your username and password, and then it shows you a list of your test results (with a red-dot if anything in them was abnormal), and you can tap on a result to view the details. Super simple, easy-peasy, and way faster.

Enjoy!
